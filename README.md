# Dockerized Odoo with HTTPS

## Image

- Odoo:13.0
- Postgres:11.7
- Nginx:1.16.1 (Reverse Proxy)

## Reverse Proxy Configuration

in `/volumes/nginx/config/conf.d/sites-enabled/odoo.conf`
- Change **tempatkerja.com** to the desired domain.
  - Make sure you have forwarded the domain to the desired destination IP address in the domain's DNS configuration.

## Database Configuration

in `docker-compose.yml`
- Match the environment variables between services web (HOST, USER, PASSWORD) and db (POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_USER)

## Troubleshooting

- To view the log generated by the services, run `sudo docker-compose logs`
